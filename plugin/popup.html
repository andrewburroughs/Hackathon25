    <p>Terms of Service

      Effective Date: 04/05/2024
      
      Welcome to our hackathon demo application (“App”). Before you dive in, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service ("Terms"). By using this App, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you disagree — or feel uncomfortable — close the App immediately and walk away dramatically.
      
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      1. Purpose
      This App is a prototype created solely for educational purposes during a hackathon. It is designed to demonstrate real-time audio and video interception, face detection, and data scrambling. It is not intended for public release, commercial use, or ethical tranquility.
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      2. What This App Does
      By using this App, you acknowledge that:
      
          1. It accesses your microphone and camera.
      
          2. It may scramble your voice, blur your face, or do neither, depending on how we feel.
      
          3. It might send your face and voice to a local server for “processing.”
      
          4. That “processing” may involve blurring, deepfaking, saving, replaying, or turning you into a meme.
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      3. No Promises
      We do not guarantee that this App:
      
          1. Works reliably,
      
          2. Respects your dignity,
      
          3. Or won’t randomly post your synthetic voice onto a subreddit called r/DeepFakedByHackers.
      
      Use at your own risk, and ideally with a VPN, sunglasses, and a fake mustache.
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      4. Data & Privacy
      This is the fun part. By using this App, you:
      
          1. Grant us access to your camera and microphone.
      
          2. Acknowledge that data may be stored, analyzed, modified, or made to say things you didn’t say.
      
          3. Understand that the data might be saved locally, transmitted, or used for dark science.
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      5. Governing Law
      These Terms are governed by no one, least of all your conscience. You’re in a hackathon. Chaos reigns. Let’s not pretend otherwise.
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      6. Final Clause
      We reserve the right to your face and audio to do with what we please.
      
      This clause exists solely to make sure you're paying attention.
      
      Please don’t use this App without reading the Terms of Service. Seriously. That’s the whole lesson.
